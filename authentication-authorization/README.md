# Mutating Data

This project is part of the course [Next.js 15 & React - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide) by [Maximilian Schwarzmüller](https://github.com/mschwarzmueller). In this fifth project, we delve into implementing robust authentication and authorization mechanisms using Next.js and React. The project demonstrates practical techniques to secure applications, manage user sessions, and control access to resources effectively.
