# Mutating Data

This project is part of the course [Next.js 15 & React - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide) by [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller](https://github.com/mschwarzmueller). In this fourth project, we explore caching mechanisms in Next.js and React to optimize performance and enhance user experience. By leveraging these techniques, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how to efficiently manage data in modern web applications.
